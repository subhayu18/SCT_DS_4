# SCT_DS_4 - Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project analyzes patterns in traffic accident data, with focus on weather, road conditions, and time of day.

## ✅ Task Overview
> Analyse traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Simulated a small traffic accident dataset for offline analysis
- Explored accident frequency across time of day and weather
- Visualized severity variations across road conditions
- Created a correlation heatmap to understand contributing factors

## 📊 Visualizations
- Count of accidents by time of day
- Accident count by weather condition
- Boxplot of severity by road surface
- Heatmap showing correlation between severity and external conditions

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 📁 File List
- `task4_accident_analysis.py` – Code for data creation, analysis, and plotting
- `README.md` – This file
